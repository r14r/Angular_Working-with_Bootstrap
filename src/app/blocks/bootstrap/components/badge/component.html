<h2>Example</h2>

Badges scale to match the size of the immediate parent element by using relative font sizing and `em` units. As of v5,
badges no longer have focus or hover styles for links.

<h1>Example heading <span class="badge bg-secondary">New</span></h1>
<h2>Example heading <span class="badge bg-secondary">New</span></h2>
<h3>Example heading <span class="badge bg-secondary">New</span></h3>
<h4>Example heading <span class="badge bg-secondary">New</span></h4>
<h5>Example heading <span class="badge bg-secondary">New</span></h5>
<h6>Example heading <span class="badge bg-secondary">New</span></h6>

Badges can be used as part of links or buttons to provide a counter.

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
  Notifications <span class="badge bg-secondary">4</span>
</button>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
  Notifications <span class="badge badge-light">4</span>
</button>
<p>
  Note that depending on how they are used, badges may be confusing for users of screen readers and similar assistive
  technologies. While the styling of badges provides a visual cue as to their purpose, these users will simply be
  presented with the content of the badge. Depending on the specific situation, these badges may seem like random
  additional words or numbers at the end of a sentence, link, or button.
</p>

<p>
  Unless the context is clear (as with the "Notifications" example, where it is understood that the "4" is the number of
  notifications), consider including additional context with a visually hidden piece of additional text.
</p>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
  Profile <span class="badge bg-secondary">9</span>
  <span class="sr-only">unread messages</span>
</button>

<h2>Background colors</h2>
<p>
  Use our background utility classes to quickly change the appearance of a badge. Please note that when using
  Bootstrap's
  default `.bg-light`, you'll likely need a text color utility like `.text-dark` for proper styling. This is because
  background utilities do not set anything but `background-color`.

<h2>Pill badges</h2>

  Use the `.rounded-pill` utility class to make badges more rounded with a larger `border-radius`.
